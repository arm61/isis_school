# An introduction to Fourier transforms

## What is a Fourier transform?

The [Fourier transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform) is fundamental to the scattering of all radiation, including **neutrons**. 
The scattering interaction between radiation and some sample essentially performs a Fourier transform on the radiation, leading to the scattering pattern that we measure. 

Before we look in more detail at Fourier transforms and scattering, watch the video below from [3Blue1Brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com) which gives a great overview of the Fourier transform. 
```{note}
This video focuses on the decomposition of something in the time domain, but for elastic scattering, we are interested in the analogous decomposition in the space domain (hence we measure $q$ in units of Å<sup>-1</sup>).

We can now go on to consider the impact of Fourier transforms in neutron reflectometry.
