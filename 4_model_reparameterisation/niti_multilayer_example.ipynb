    "# NiTi multilayer example\n",
    "\n",
    "For our first example, we will consider a simple hard matter system, where there is a **repeating multilayer** of nickel and titanium that has been deposited on a piece of silicon. \n",
    "The process by which these systems are prepared typically involves the disposition of a layer of titanium, followed by a layer of nickel, followed by titanium, this process is repeated until the desired number of layers is reached. \n",
    "Below we show, graphically, a model that we may use for the simulation of reflectometry data from such a system. \n",

    "A graphical example of the NiTi multilayer system consisting of three repeats. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A common assumption that is made in the analysis of reflectometry data from such a sample include that the structure of each repeat is the same.\n",
    "Therefore the model can be defined such that there are only a **limited number of variables**.\n",
    "However, this can still be unclear, as three of these parameters will be the scattering length densities of nickel, titanium, and silicon. \n",
    "While these values can be obtained from [online databases](https://slddb.esss.dk/slddb/), we can also reparameterise these in terms of the mass density of the material. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Scattering length density → Mass density\n",
    "\n",
    "The scattering length density, $\\textrm{SLD}$, for a material is directly related to its mass density, $\\rho$, \n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: density\n",
    "\\\textrm{SLD} = \\frac{\\rho N_a \\sum_{i=1}^{N}b_i}{M_w}, \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where, $N_a$ is Avogadro's constant, $b_i$ are the neutron scattering lengths for each of the $N$ elements in the material, and $M_w$ is the molecular mass of the material.\n",
    "Therefore, if we consider nickel, which has a density of $8.908$ gcm<sup>-3</sup> at room temperature and a [scattering length](https://www.ncnr.nist.gov/resources/n-lengths/elements/ni.html) of $10.3$ fm, the scattering length density is found as follows, \n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: calc\n",
    "\\\textrm{SLD}_{\\mathrm{Ni}} = \\frac{\\rho_{\\mathrm{Ni}} N_a b_{\\mathrm{Ni}}}{M_{w, \\mathrm{Ni}}} = \\frac{8.91 [\\mathrm{g cm}^{-3}] \\cdot 6.022\\times 10^{23} [\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}] \\cdot 10.3 [\\mathrm{fm}]}{58.69 [\\mathrm{g mol}^{-1}]} = 9.417\\times 10^{-6} [\\mathrm{Å}^{-2}].\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We evaluate this in the code below. "
